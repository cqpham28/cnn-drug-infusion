## Dataset 
We ultizlied the mathematical models's parameters from the previous study, using anesthetized and ventilated dogs with acute heart failure. We calculate the response data changes from the baseline (right after acute heart failure event), then the data were averaged every 30s.

## Drug Controller
Our approach is to propose a cost function utilizing the regulation role of the CNN model, then we determine the optimal drug infusion rate DB and SN to minimize the cost function.
